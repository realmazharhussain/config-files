    <p>
      Multan has always remained a centre of excellence in education. Hazrat Bahauddin Zakariya (1172 - 1262 A.D.), a
      Muslim religious scholar and saint, established a school of higher learning in theology in Multan; where scholars
      from all over the world came for studies and research. Multan has maintained its central position and centuries
      old cultural heritage and therefore suited ideally to become a center of learning. Thus the University of Multan
      was established in 1975 by an Act of the Punjab Legislative Assembly. To pay homage to the Great Saint, the name
      was changed from University of Multan to Bahauddin Zakariya University in 1979.
